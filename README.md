## Estimation of Ï€:
Classic example where the area of a circle can be estimated via Monte Carlo, and then be used to calculate the value of $\pi$.

## Estimate of Euler's number (*e*):
A more obscure example whereby you can estimate *e* by using Monte Carlo integration to calculate the area of all probability simplexes.
